# Training Neural Networks with Manifold Constraints via PyTorch

In the following several examples, we mainly aim to illustrate that it is easy to describe neural networks with manifold constraints by the build-in layers in CDOpt based on PyTorch package. Therefore, training these networks can be greatly facilitated by the advanced features  from PyTorch and various optimizers provided by PyTorch and torch-optimizer packages.
