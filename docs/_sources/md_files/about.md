# About CDOpt



## Developers

The Python version of CDOptis developed by Nachuan Xiao, Xiaoyin Hu, Xin Liu and Kim-Chuan Toh. The package is stable and can be used right away. Being research software, it is also perpetually work in progress. We welcome contributions, bug reports and feedback. 



## Cite CDOpt

If you publish work that uses or refers to CDOpt, please cite the following two papers, which respectively propose the constraint dissolving approaches and describes the CDOpt package:

1. Xiao N, Liu X, Toh K C. Constraint Dissolving Approaches for Riemannian Optimization[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.10319, 2022.

2. TBD



Moreover, if your work uses or refers to the PyTorch layers from `cdopt.utils_torch` with orthogonally constrained weights, we strongly you to refer the following paper,

1. Hu X, Xiao N, Liu X, et al. A Constraint Dissolving Approach for Nonsmooth Optimization over the Stiefel Manifold[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.10500, 2022.
