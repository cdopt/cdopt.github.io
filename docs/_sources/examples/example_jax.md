# Training Neural Networks with Manifold Constraints via JAX and FLAX

In the following several examples, we mainly aim to illustrate that it is easy to describe neural networks with manifold constraints by the build-in layers in CDOpt based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and [FLAX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/). Therefore, training these networks can be greatly facilitated by the advanced features  from JAX and FLAX and various optimizers provided by [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages.
